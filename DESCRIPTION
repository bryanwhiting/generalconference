Description: "General conference is the worldwide gathering of The Church of 
    Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Twice a year, during the first weekend of
    April and the first weekend of October, Church leaders from around the world
    share messages or sermons focused on the living Christ and His gospel. 
    Viewers learn how to find peace, hope, and joy in Jesus Christ; 
    how to strengthen families by following Jesus’s teachings; and how to 
    receive personal guidance and inspiration from God."
