  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

The data structure includes the metadata of the talk with a nested dataframe 
with the paragraphs of the text.

```{r setup}
library(generalconference)

url <- "https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/04/49nelson?lang=eng"
scrape_talk(url)
```
Simply unnest the paragraphs column to get all paragraphs for a talk:
```{r}
scrape_talk(url) %>%
  tidyr::unnest(paragraphs)
```
